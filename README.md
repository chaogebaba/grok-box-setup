# grok-box-setup

Turn a Grok sand box into a self-healing **Tailscale exit node** with password
SSH, reachable as `grok-box-N` on the tailnet — and keep it that way through
sleep/thaw cycles and full image swaps.

Everything is one program: [`boxup`](boxup), installed at
`/workspace/box-setup/boxup`.

## Quick start (on the box, as the `box` user)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaogebaba/grok-box-setup.git /tmp/grok-box-setup
sudo bash /tmp/grok-box-setup/install.sh
sudo /workspace/box-setup/boxup once
```

If the box has never joined the tailnet, `boxup status` prints an `auth=` URL —
open it, approve the node, run `boxup once` again. With a reusable auth key in
`secrets/ts-authkey` the join is unattended. Full operator procedure:
[docs/AGENT.md](docs/AGENT.md).

## Commands

```
boxup once      full converge + health tick + status   (hourly keep-alive contract)
boxup ensure    full converge only
boxup up        converge + start the selfheal worker   (default)
boxup tick      one health tick
boxup status    one-line health string
boxup stop      stop the selfheal worker (tailscaled stays up)
boxup update    fresh clone from GitHub + reinstall (never git pull)
```

`box-bootstrap.sh` remains as a shim (`--once` → `boxup once`) because the
external hourly automation calls it by that name.

## How it survives

| Event | What dies | What brings it back |
|---|---|---|
| sleep / thaw | tailscaled's map poll (node goes grey) | selfheal worker: stale-heartbeat freeze detection recycles tailscaled |
| image swap | everything outside `/workspace`: packages, `/etc/shadow`, sshd config, host keys, nft rules, all processes | hourly `boxup once` re-converges from `/workspace/box-setup`: vendored binaries in `bin/`, node identity in `state/tailscale/`, ssh host keys in `state/ssh/` |
| process crash | sshd / tailscaled / worker | worker restarts procs; hourly `once` restarts the worker |

Design, environment facts, and the reasoning behind every special case:
[docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Configuration

`/workspace/box-setup/config.toml` (seeded once, never overwritten):
SSH password (`[ssh] password`, default `12345678`), pinned tailscale version
(`[tailscale] version`), update repo (`[update] repo`). See
[etc/config.example.toml](etc/config.example.toml).

## House rules

- No systemd, no cron — the platform has neither. tini is PID 1.
- Never `pkill -f`; processes are matched by exact argv and killed by PID.
- `tailscale up` only for the first login; `tailscale set` afterwards.
- One tailscaled, bound to `--statedir=/workspace/box-setup/state/tailscale`.
- Box identity (`state/`, `hostname`, auth keys) never enters git.
